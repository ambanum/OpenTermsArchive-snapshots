"text":"If someone outside of Google discovers a security vulnerability in one of our devices, we want to know about it. To qualify for a monetary award, the researcher must wait for Google to patch the vulnerability before disclosing it to anyone else. This program creates an incentive for security researchers around the world to help us make our devices more secure."},

{"@type":"Question",
"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer",
"text":"We have dedicated security teams that analyze the hardware and software of each device before it\u2019s available to the public, and we do our best to make sure our devices are secure. After the initial verification is performed, we also continue to analyze risks and security threats after devices are introduced and provide automatic, <a href='\"https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/10231940\"'>critical security updates for at least 5 years</a>."},

When 2-step verification is enabled, anyone signing in to your account will need to complete a second step, or \u201cfactor,\u201d before signing in. You can choose from multiple second factors, including a text message, a code from the Google Authenticator app, or a notification from an installed Google app."},
"name":"How does 2-step verification protect my account?"},
{"@type":"Question",
"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer",
"text":"Migrating to a Google Account gives you new benefits, like:\n<br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic security protections such as suspicious activity detection, 2-step verification, and Security Checkup.</li>\n<li>Your Google Nest devices and services work together. For example, if you have a Nest Cam and a Chromecast, just say, \u201cHey Google, show me the backyard camera\u201d to cast your camera stream to your TV without any setup.</li>\n<li>One account to sign into both the Nest and Google Home apps.</li>\n<li>Your homes and home members are aligned across the Nest and Google Home apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><br>\nAnyone with an existing Nest Account can migrate to a Google Account. To migrate your account, in the <b>Nest app</b>, go to <b>Account settings</b>, and then select <b>Migrate to a Google Account</b>."},

"text":"Yes, but only as part of the Face Match setup process, and not after you\u2019ve completed setup. When you set up Face Match on your Nest Hub Max, you use your phone to capture several photos that are combined to create a unique model of your face. These photos are sent to Google, and you can review or delete them anytime by visiting <a href='\"https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity\"'>My Activity</a>. After this setup process, Face Match does not send any video or images to Google. And Quick Gestures does not require sending any video or images to Google at all. In addition, we keep the video and images that power these features separate from advertising and don\u2019t use them for ad personalization."},

{"@type":"Question",
"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer",
"text":"Some models of our cameras support recording video footage while offline. For these cameras, video footage will be uploaded when the camera goes back online after the video footage has been recorded. That means you may not see a visual indicator when your camera is sending the video footage to our servers -- but in those instances, a visual indicator would have been visible when the camera was actually recording the video footage."},

"text":"Our devices include environmental and activity sensors that detect information about your home\u2019s environment and what\u2019s happening in it, such as motion, whether or not someone is home, ambient light, temperature, and humidity. Data from these sensors, which is regularly sent to Google, serves a variety of purposes, such as helping your home take better care of you, helping us make your devices and services better, and keeping you informed. For example:\n<br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>The temperature and humidity sensors in your Nest Learning Thermostat help keep your home comfortable while saving energy.</li>\n<li>Home/Away Assist uses activity sensors across multiple Nest devices in your home to automatically switch the behavior of Nest devices in your home when you leave and when you come back.</li>\n<li>We used ambient light and temperature sensor data aggregated from thermostats across our customers to determine that direct sunlight can cause thermostats to think it\u2019s warmer than it actually is, so we introduced <a href='\"https://nest.com/support/article/What-is-Sunblock\"'>Sunblock</a>, a new feature, to help your thermostat adjust for this so it sets the correct temperature.</li>\n<li>We use sensor data to help us troubleshoot and improve the performance, safety, and reliability of our devices and services \u2013 for example, we use temperature and humidity data from our devices to measure the impact of environmental conditions on battery life.</li>\n<li>We may also use sensor data to keep you informed of updates on Google services, including connected home services we think may interest you, such as energy and home safety programs \u2013 but we\u2019ll always respect your choice about whether or not you want to receive promotional emails from Google.</li>\n<li>We do not use environmental and activity sensor data for ad personalization. For example we don\u2019t use sleep data from your Nest Hub (2nd. gen) for ad personalization. (Remember that to fulfill some requests related to your connected home devices \u2014 for example, \u201cHey Google, what\u2019s the temperature inside?\u201d \u2014 your Assistant can retrieve a sensor reading. Learn more about the Google Assistant and the choices available to you <a href='\"http://myaccount.google.com/yourdata/assistant\"'>here</a>.)</li>\n<li>When you delete your account, this sensor data is deleted from our servers as explained in our <a href='\"https://policies.google.com/technologies/retention?hl=en-US\"'>retention policy</a>.</li>\n</ul>"},

This industry practice provides monetary rewards and public recognition for external security researchers who disclose vulnerabilities to the Nest Security team.

      <p>Migrating to a Google Account gives you new benefits, like:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Automatic security protections such as suspicious activity detection, 2-step verification, and Security Checkup.</li>
<li>Your Google Nest devices and services work together. For example, if you have a Nest Cam and a Chromecast, just say, “Hey Google, show me the backyard camera” to cast your camera stream to your TV without any setup.</li>
<li>One account to sign into both the Nest and Google Home apps.</li>
<li>Your homes and home members are aligned across the Nest and Google Home apps.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Anyone with an existing Nest Account can migrate to a Google Account. To migrate your account, in the <b>Nest app</b>, go to <b>Account settings</b>, and then select <b>Migrate to a Google Account</b>.</p>

      <p>Yes, but only as part of the Face Match setup process, and not after you’ve completed setup. When you set up Face Match on your Nest Hub Max, you use your phone to capture several photos that are combined to create a unique model of your face. These photos are sent to Google, and you can review or delete them anytime by visiting <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">My Activity</a>. After this setup process, Face Match does not send any video or images to Google. And Quick Gestures does not require sending any video or images to Google at all. In addition, we keep the video and images that power these features separate from advertising and don’t use them for ad personalization.</p>

        <p>Some of our devices include sensors that detect information about your home’s environment and what’s happening in it, such as motion, whether or not someone is home, ambient light, temperature, and humidity. These sensors serve a variety of purposes, such as helping your home take better care of you – like when your Nest Learning Thermostat turns itself down when you’re away – and helping us make your devices and services better.

      <p>Our devices include environmental and activity sensors that detect information about your home’s environment and what’s happening in it, such as motion, whether or not someone is home, ambient light, temperature, and humidity. Data from these sensors, which is regularly sent to Google, serves a variety of purposes, such as helping your home take better care of you, helping us make your devices and services better, and keeping you informed. For example:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The temperature and humidity sensors in your Nest Learning Thermostat help keep your home comfortable while saving energy.</li>
<li>Home/Away Assist uses activity sensors across multiple Nest devices in your home to automatically switch the behavior of Nest devices in your home when you leave and when you come back.</li>
<li>We used ambient light and temperature sensor data aggregated from thermostats across our customers to determine that direct sunlight can cause thermostats to think it’s warmer than it actually is, so we introduced <a href="https://nest.com/support/article/What-is-Sunblock">Sunblock</a>, a new feature, to help your thermostat adjust for this so it sets the correct temperature.</li>
<li>We use sensor data to help us troubleshoot and improve the performance, safety, and reliability of our devices and services – for example, we use temperature and humidity data from our devices to measure the impact of environmental conditions on battery life.</li>
<li>We may also use sensor data to keep you informed of updates on Google services, including connected home services we think may interest you, such as energy and home safety programs – but we’ll always respect your choice about whether or not you want to receive promotional emails from Google.</li>
<li>We do not use environmental and activity sensor data for ad personalization. For example we don’t use sleep data from your Nest Hub (2nd. gen) for ad personalization. (Remember that to fulfill some requests related to your connected home devices — for example, “Hey Google, what’s the temperature inside?” — your Assistant can retrieve a sensor reading. Learn more about the Google Assistant and the choices available to you <a href="http://myaccount.google.com/yourdata/assistant">here</a>.)</li>
<li>When you delete your account, this sensor data is deleted from our servers as explained in our <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/retention?hl=en-US">retention policy</a>.</li>

      <p>Google Wifi collects and uses data as explained <a href="https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6246642?hl=en">here</a>, including information about the types of connected devices you have and their network usage. The cloud services, Wifi point stats, and app stats data described <a href="https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6246642">here</a> (which we refer to as “Wi-Fi network performance data”) is not used for ad personalization. We may use this data to keep you informed about updates on Google services, including connected home devices and services we think may help you — such as an additional Wifi point to improve your internet connectivity. You can opt out from certain portions of this data collection as explained <a href="https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6246642">here</a>.

Google Wifi does not track the websites you visit, nor does it monitor the content of traffic on your Wi-Fi network. Google Wifi sets your default DNS provider to “Automatic,” which uses Google Public DNS or your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) DNS if certain conditions are met. More info on what Google Public DNS collects can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/privacy">here</a>. You can change your DNS provider in the <a href="https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6274141">Advanced Networking settings</a> of the Google Home app at any time.</p>
