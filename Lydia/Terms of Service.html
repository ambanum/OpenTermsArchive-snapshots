<h2><span lang="EN-GB">2. Purpose of the Lydia T&amp;Cs for Consumers *</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">These T&amp;Cs, and the </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price?tab=price">Prices</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price?tab=limit">Thresholds</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> Appendices are used to inform the Consumer on the conditions applicable to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Managing the Consumer's account (the "Consumer Account") associated with their payment accounts (the "Payment Account(s)");</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">The execution of payment orders;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">All the services and products offered by Lydia (the "Service");</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Certain related services may be subject to additional agreements that the Consumer will be asked to read and accept later if they want access to them.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">By accepting these terms, the Consumer undertakes to use the Lydia Service in accordance with its purposes and under the conditions described in these Terms of Service for Consumers.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB">3. Cessation of Lydia T&amp;Cs for Consumers</span></h2>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">At the initiative of the </span>Consumer</h3>
<p><b>Withdrawal</b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer may make use of their right of withdrawal within 14 (fourteen) calendar days of starting their membership of one of the paid services governed by these T&amp;Cs, in accordance with article L.227-7 of the French Consumer Code, by sending a letter to the address indicated in Article 17 hereof.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The commencement of execution does not deprive the Consumer of the right of withdrawal. The Consumer will be required to pay the price corresponding to the use of the product for the period between the date of commencement of execution of these T&amp;Cs and the date of withdrawal, to the exclusion of any other sum.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer must withdraw using the form attached to the last page of these T&amp;Cs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Termination</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The </span>Consumer is a Lydia member for an indefinite period.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer can terminate their Lydia membership at any time, and to this end request the closure of their Lydia Consumer Account by paying, if applicable, all sums due. The Consumer may also have the balance on their Payment Accounts transferred to a bank account opened in their name with a credit institution, as defined by article L.511-1 of the Monetary and Finance Code (Bank Account), prior to closing the Consumer Account.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">To implement this, the Consumer shall contact Lydia Support by email at the address support@lydia-app.com. An email will be sent to them confirming the termination within 5 working days of receiving the termination request.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Death of the Consumer</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The death of the </span>Consumer ends their membership of the Lydia Service from the moment it is brought to the attention of Lydia. Transactions carried out from the deceased's Lydia Payment Accounts after the time of death are considered to be unauthorised, except with the agreement of the beneficiaries or the notary in charge of the succession. The Lydia Consumer Account is kept open for the time necessary to settle the succession and Lydia ensures the settlement of the balance with the agreement of the beneficiaries or the notary in charge of the succession.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">If in the three years following the death of the Consumer the beneficiaries have not made themselves known or have not asserted their rights, the balance of the Payment Accounts of the deceased Consumer is paid to the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (Deposits and Consignments Fund).</span></p>
<h3><strong><span lang="EN-GB">At the initiative of Lydia</span></strong></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia may terminate the Consumer's access to the Service without charge by simple email notification after the expiration of a thirty calendar day notice period.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">However, Lydia is exempt from respecting the notice period and may close the Lydia Consumer Account in immediately the event of seriously reprehensible behaviour by the Consumer (in particular if the Consumer refuses to provide information or provides false or inaccurate documents, or if they threaten or insult a Lydia employee), or they fail to comply with one of the obligations of these T&amp;Cs for Consumers. In this case, the Consumer may be required to pay adjustment/file processing fees (see </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price">Prices</a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> Appendix).</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Effect of termination *</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">At the end of the termination and after settlement of the operations in progress, Lydia will close the Consumer Account and transfer the balance of the amount in the Lydia Payment Accounts, minus any costs relating to the Lydia Service, to the </span>Consumer's Bank Account using the details previously provided to Lydia Support or stored in the application.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">If the Consumer does not reclaim its funds, their Lydia Payment Account will be considered as inactive and subject to inactivity fees on the terms set here bellow (cf. Inactivity fees).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The closure results in the deactivation of the Lydia Service.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The closing of a Lydia Consumer Account is irrevocable and prevents the Consumer from opening another Lydia Consumer Account (at least for a period of one year or definitively in the event of violation of these T&amp;Cs or legally reprehensible act).</span></p>

<ul>
<ol>
<li>Secure payment, by 3DS, with a bank card in the first and last names of the Consumer and linked to an account opened with a financial institution established in the European Union or the European Economic Area;</li>

</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer will also be requested to specify his residential address.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In the context of exceptional events, the Consumer can also obtain the "Verified User" status by a face-to-face verification of their identity with an authorised Lydia Agent. In this case, the Consumer presents their current identity document to the authorised Lydia Agent, who will check its validity. The Lydia Agent will take a copy and confirm the face-to-face meeting by sending an email.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB">8. How Lydia works</span></h2>
<h3><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Step 1: Opening a Payment Account</span></strong></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">To benefit from the Service, the Consumer accepts the opening of at least one Payment Account when subscribing. Lydia sends the Consumer a message acknowledging receipt of their request and informing them of the opening of a Payment Account, under the conditions described in Article 17 hereof.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A Payment Account is denominated in Euros (€) and records the payment, collection and transfer operations carried out by or for the benefit of the Consumer. All Payment Accounts related to a Consumer Account are denominated in the same currency.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A Consumer can only issue or receive payments in the currency in which their Payment Accounts are denominated. Thus, if the Consumer's Bank Account is in a different currency to their Lydia Payment Accounts, </span><span lang="EN-GB">its banking institution might charge conversion fees.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A Payment Account can never be used as a Bank account.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The balance of a Payment Account cannot be in debit.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Step 2: Adding a payment method to the Consumer Account</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Consumers can register a bank card, of which they are the holder, in the  Application in order to use it as a means of payment for payment transactions or to recharge one of their Payment accounts.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia has set up a priority selection mechanism for bank cards issued by the CB group of bank cards. Consumers can override the automatic priority selection by choosing another brand from those displayed as "accepted" by Lydia (see</span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/xjwfni0o3m-we-accept-the-following-bank-cards"> Lydia Manual&gt; Accepted bank cards)</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The deposit account agreement governing the bank card must authorise the transfer of funds by card. The Consumer then receives confirmation of the addition of a payment means under the conditions provided for in Article 17 "Method of communication between Lydia and the Consumer" &gt; "Communicating with the Consumer".</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer accepts that the data relating to their card is kept by Lydia's technical service providers in charge of debiting and managing user payment cards (service providers responsible for implementing the secure software and protocols required for registration, transmission and secure processing of card fund transfer orders), for the sole purpose of executing their payment transactions or recharging of their Payment Accounts.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Step 3: Payment transaction</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The </span>Consumer can initiate a payment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Either as part of a face-to-face payment with the Beneficiary, via a QR code or via Bluetooth (if device is compatible);</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Or as part of a remote payment:</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">With the Lydia Application, by selecting the payment beneficiary from the contacts in their directory (which implies that the Consumer has agreed to link the contact directory to the Lydia application) or by entering their telephone number, email address or IBAN number;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">With the Lydia Application, by accepting a request for payment issued by another Private or Professional Consumer using the Lydia PRO Service;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">With a bank card, outside the Lydia Application, by performing a payment transaction through a CB Form offered by a Private or Professional Consumer using the Lydia PRO Service.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The payment means (Lydia balance, bank card or Bank Account) of the paying Consumer is debited immediately and the Beneficiary's Payment Account, if the latter has a Lydia Consumer Account, is credited upon receipt of confirmation from the Lydia technical service provider in charge of debiting the payment method. The transaction cannot be cancelled either by the payer or by Lydia. Only the beneficiary can, by whatever means, return the funds to the payer (see </span><span lang="EN-GB">15</span><span lang="EN-GB">. Th</span><span lang="EN-GB">e responsibility of the </span>Consumer &gt; Final payment order).</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Unless the Consumer directly enters the IBAN of the Beneficiary, if the beneficiary does not hold a Lydia Consumer Account, they then receive an SMS or an email inviting them to install the Lydia application or to perform a transfer to their Bank Account by entering their IBAN within seven days. After this period, the transaction is cancelled and the payment means used is re-credited.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">When consenting to the execution of a payment, the Consumer selects the payment means they wish to use to debit the funds. The operation can only be carried out if the selected payment means is linked to an account with sufficient funds.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">An electronic transaction receipt is sent to the Consumer, under the conditions set out in Article 17 "Method of communication between Lydia and the </span>Consumer" &gt; "Communicating with the Consumer".</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Banking Partner may refuse a payment order. The Consumer will be informed of the reason for refusal the day following the refusal at the latest, unless a national or European provision prohibits it.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer is solely responsible for the payment transactions they issue. Once a transaction has been carried out and confirmed, the selected payment means is debited. Lydia cannot be held responsible in the event of an error made by the Consumer.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Step 4: Receipt of funds (collection)</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The funds are credited to the Beneficiary's Consumer Account instantly if the latter is a professional or is already a Consumer.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Otherwise, the Beneficiary is informed of the transaction by SMS or email and can receive funds within seven days:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">By downloading the Lydia Application;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">By making a transfer to the Bank Account of their choice. To do this, the Beneficiary provides their IBAN.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Otherwise, after seven days, the transaction is cancelled and the Consumer Account issuing the payment is re-credited.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Step 5: Transferring funds to the Bank Account</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Consumers can, if they wish, transfer all or part of their Lydia balance to the Bank Account of their choice, within the limits set out by the conditions in the </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price">Pricing</a><a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price"> and Limits Appendices</a>. To do this, the </span>Consumer is requested to provide the IBAN relating to the Bank Account to which they wish to make a transfer. This can be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Aggregating their bank to the Application. In this case, they must accept the <a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/info/terms-budgea-bank-1.html">Budget</a><a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/info/terms-budgea-bank-1.html"> </a><a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/info/terms-budgea-bank-1.html">Insight General Conditions of Use</a> (this functionality is only available in certain countries for Consumers with a local telephone number, for more information please read the <a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/lcu8v7dbca-which-countries-are-eligible">Manu</a><a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en/article/lcu8v7dbca-which-countries-are-eligible">al</a>);</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Directly entering their IBAN in the Application.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">If the </span>Consumer Account is blocked, they should refer to the section "How Lydia ensures the security of its Service".</p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The funds of the Consumer are deposited in an account opened with a credit institution </span><span lang="EN-GB">in the name and on behalf of the SFPMEI. Thus confined, the funds benefit from the guarantee provided for in </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072026&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000031076000">article L312-4-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">,</span><span lang="EN-GB"> up to the amount of 100,000 Euros per Consumer (as provided for in </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;jsessionid=71DE0CCC077E89705E5C906515A1C69B.tplgfr21s_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000031399062&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000031399043&amp;dateTexte=20191018">article 5 of the decree of 27 October 2015</a>).</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Identification through strong authentication</span></h3>
<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Accessing a Consumer Account</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">When subscribing to the Service, Consumers must register their identifiers on the Lydia Application. Consumers must register two identifiers, their email and their mobile phone number, associated with a password. The Consumer must take all the measures necessary to ensure the security of their tablet or mobile phone and their personalised security device. They must keep their personalised security devices absolutely secret and not communicate them to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">To ensure that passwords are secure, they must respect a certain format. The identifiers allow the Consumer to login when the Application is opened for the first time, when the Application is disconnected and each time a connection is made with a new mobile device.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The combination of one of the two identifiers and the password constitutes the personalised security device made available to the Consumer by Lydia, which is specific to the Consumer and placed under their protection.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In certain cases, the use of the personalised security device is coupled with a single-use password, with the aim of performing strong authentication of the Consumer.</span></p>
<h4><span lang="EN-GB">Performing an operation</span></h4>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">When using the Application, the Consumer must register a four-digit personal security code. This code must be entered during recharging, payment and reimbursement operations carried out at the request of the Consumer, as well as when consulting sensitive payment information.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">By entering and validating their personalised security device and confirming the transaction, the Consumer gives their definitive consent to the payment order. From this moment, the Consumer can no longer revoke their order. It is also at this moment that Lydia receives the execution order, except in the case of a face to face transfer, where the reception of the order occurs during the code scan by the beneficiary of the transfer (see Lydia user manual).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">For more information on personalised security devices, the Consumer should consult the </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/en">Lydia Manual.</a></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Each time they register or enter their personal identifiers, the Consumer must ensure that their environment is secure.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Communications with the Service are made only through secure channels. Lydia does not, for example, ever request the provision of confidential data via a website. If the Consumer has a doubt about the legitimacy of a request relating to the provision of confidential data, it is recommended they do not provide this data and should contact Lydia support via the email address </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="mailto:support@lydia-app.com">support@lydia-app.com.</a></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">The fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">They can carry out all the procedures necessary for the identification of the </span>Consumer<span lang="EN-GB"> and the beneficiary. They can also obtain information from the </span>Consumer about the purpose and origin of the funds received and their destination.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer undertakes to perform all due diligence to allow Lydia and the Partners to carry out a detailed examination of the operations, to inform them of any exceptional operation in relation to the operations usually recorded in their Consumer Account and to provide them with all document or information required.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The </span>Consumer acknowledges that Lydia and its Partners may be required to set up surveillance systems with the aim of combating money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer also recognises that Lydia and its Partners may issue reports to the competent authorities, voluntarily or on request.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer acknowledges that Lydia or its Partners may at any time terminate or postpone the opening of the Lydia Consumer Account, or the execution of an operation in the absence of sufficient information on its object or nature.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In this respect, no prosecution based on article </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006417945&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20020101">226-13 of the penal code</a> and no civil liability action can be brought against Lydia or its Partners, their managers or their employees who have in good faith made the declarations mentioned in articles <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000033517859&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072026&amp;dateTexte=20200227">L.561-15 and subsequent of the Monetary and Financial Code.</a></span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">When a Lydia Consumer Account may be blocked</span></h3>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Passing limits</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As soon as an operation leads to the passing of one of the limits mentioned in the </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/about/price?tab=price">Limits</a> Appendix in relation to the Verified User status and where, if applicable, the Consumer does not provide the information or documents necessary for the verification of their identity, Lydia will be unable to execute the transaction and the Lydia Consumer Account of the Consumer will be temporarily blocked.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The requested operation can be carried out as soon as the Consumer has provided the required documents and evidence and Lydia has verified said documents provided by the Consumer. The latter will then receive an email confirmation of the unblocking of their Consumer Account.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A Consumer can also be blocked if the amount of their transactions, singular or cumulative, exceeds certain ceilings within a given time (see </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price">Pricing and Limits Appendi</a><a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price">ces</a>). Exceeding these limits temporarily prevents operations from being carried out.</span></p>
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Security measures</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia may also block access to the Service and to the Lydia Consumer Account of the Consumer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">In the event of a suspected unauthorised or fraudulent transaction;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">In the event of a significantly increased or proven risk that the paying Consumer is unable to fulfil their payment obligation;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">If it turns out that the Consumer is in breach of these T&amp;Cs, for example if they hold several Lydia Accounts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">When Lydia refuses to execute a transaction, the Consumer is immediately informed by email, as soon as possible and, in any event, within three working days of the refusal. Lydia also indicates to the Consumer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">The reasons for the refusal, unless prohibited by other community or national legislation;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">In the event of a material error, the appropriate correction;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">In case of insufficient funds, the need to recharge the Lydia Consumer Account.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">To request the unlocking of their Lydia Consumer Account, the Consumer can contact Lydia Support at the following email address: </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="mailto:support@lydia-app.com">support@lydia-app.com</a>.</span></p>

<h2><span lang="EN-GB">14. </span><span lang="EN-GB">The responsibility of the </span>Consumer *</h2>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Veracity of the personal information</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">On request, the Consumer undertakes to provide Lydia and its Partners all the information necessary to verify their identity and their transactions. The Consumer certifies the veracity of all the information they provide to Lydia or its Partners.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As a reminder, the use of false documents is punishable under articles </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006418753&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20020101">441-1 and subsequent of the Penal Code.</a> Consumers using false documents will be penalised by the closure of their Lydia Consumer Account and will be subject of a declaration to the relevant authorities.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In addition, any </span>Consumer <span lang="EN-GB">providing false information will be liable </span><span lang="EN-GB">for the payment of a penalty (see <a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price">Pricing</a><a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price"> and </a><a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price">Limits </a><a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price">Appendi</a><a href="https://lydia-app.com/gb/about/price">ces</a>).</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Strictly Personal Consumer Account</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">A Lydia Consumer Account is strictly personal. The </span>Consumer may not assign it, for a fee or free of charge, or lend it to a third party, including a relative, or dispose of it in any other way.</p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Duty of vigilance</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">When the Consumer makes a payment transaction, whether face to face or remotely, they must ensure the identity of the recipient and verify the amount of the transaction.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Likewise, in the case of remote payment, on the Internet for example, the Consumer must be vigilant in ensuring that the payment platform used by the seller is secure.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia and its Partners are not responsible for any loss due to a technical breakdown of the payment system if such is reported to the Consumer by a message on the device or in another visible manner.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Normal use</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer undertakes not to use their Lydia Payment Accounts for the purchase of services or products prohibited by law. In addition, the Consumer undertakes to make normal use of their Consumer Account and Payment Accounts in order to exclusively perform the operations for which the Application is intended.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Credit Payment Account</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Before each and every payment or withdrawal operation, the </span>Consumer must systematically ensure that the balance of the Payment Account selected to support the operation is sufficient and available to be able to perform the operation and must stay that way until the operation is completed.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Consumer undertakes to honour any payment order made with their Lydia Payment Accounts. The </span>Consumer assumes sole responsibility for the consequences which may arise from an insufficient or unavailable bank balance.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The existence of a dispute between the Consumer and a third party, notably due to the non-conformity of an item or service sold, may not justify the refusal to honour a payment order.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">All actual costs and expenses incurred for enforced recovery by writ of execution for operations are the responsibility of the Consumer.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rectification of a negative balance</strong></p>
<p>Theoretically, the Consumer Account balance cannot become negative (less than 0). However, the Consumer Account balance may become negative following certain events (cf. <a href="https://support.lydia-app.com/l/fr/article/cn2pmndd7n-solde-lydia-negatif-paiement-carte-Lydia?vero_id=4814879">Lydia Manual</a>). If such a situation occurs, the Consumer should recharge his account. </p>
<p>The Consumer will immediately be informed of the situation and should recharge his account without delay.</p>
<p>If the Consumer does not recharge his Account within a reasonable delay, the Consumer accepts that Lydia will debit the credit card or payment card connected to the Consumer Account up to the amount required to make the Consumer balance null.</p>
<p>Under the condition provided in the “Communicating with the Consumer” article, the Consumer will be informed of :</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount debited ;</li>
<li>The credit or payment card concerned ;</li>
<li>The date of the debit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Consumer should make sure that the balance of the account connected to the credit or payment card concerned has sufficient funds.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
<p>The Consumer should contact Lydia support at support@lydia-app.com, before the scheduled date of debit if they wish to use another mean of payment. </p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Final payment order</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Consumers cannot revoke their consent once their payment orders ha</span><span lang="EN-GB">ve been received by the beneficiary's service provider.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Consent to carry out a payment transaction is given by Consumers, before or after determining the amount, by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New'; color: black;"><span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Entering their confidential code on their phone or tablet;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Remote communication and/or confirmation of the data;</span></li>

<li><span lang="EN-GB">Presenting and holding the smartphone or tablet in front of a device identifying the presence of "contactless" technology;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">The use of a biometric recognition device (e.g. fingerprint sensor on the mobile phone).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">When the </span>Consumer provides their banking data as part of a series of payment transactions, they give their consent once for all transactions. The Consumer may however withdraw their consent no later than the working day preceding the execution of a transaction.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In all cases, any Consumer facing bankruptcy cannot revoke their consent to a payment order.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB">15. </span><span lang="EN-GB">The responsibility of Lydia to Consumers *</span></h2>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Correct execution of payment orders</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia, in its role as a PSP Agent, is responsible vis-à-vis the Consumer for the proper execution of payment transactions ordered or received via the Service, namely:</span></p>

<li><span lang="EN-GB">Payment orders between two Lydia accounts;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">Transactions to or from a Lydia Payment Account.</span></li>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In the event that the Consumer incorrectly executes a transaction, Lydia shall endeavour to retrace the transaction and shall report on the result of its search, at the request of the Consumer and without any liability for Lydia provided it has respected its obligation of means.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Apart from the exceptions described below, Lydia does not cover unauthorised operations carried out before the blocking request, excluding the deductible of 50 Euros payable by the Consumer, and with the exception of the cases provided for by</span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000035430527&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072026&amp;dateTexte=20180113"> Article L.133-19 of the Monetary and Financial Code.</a></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia does not assume any financial loss in the event of gross negligence of the obligations referred to herein or fraudulent acts on the part of the Consumer.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia cannot be held responsible in the event of force majeure (an external, unpredictable and unavoidable event as defined by </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000032041431&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070721&amp;dateTexte=20161001">article 1218 of the Civil Code</a>).</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Professional secrecy</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Transactions and personal data are covered by professional secrecy to which Lydia and its Partners are bound. However, to meet legal and regulatory obligations, Lydia and its Partners are sometimes required to communicate information to the legally empowered judicial or administrative authorities.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia cannot be held liable for the direct and indirect consequences linked to measures imposed on it by legal or regulatory provisions, in particular the freezing of assets, which it may have to implement in the context of obligations enforced upon it by the public authorities, in particular in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. As such, Lydia cannot be held responsible for any delays in execution that may be caused.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">Continuity of service and malfunctions</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia will make its best efforts to ensure the continuity of the Service. However, Lydia cannot be held liable with respect to the Consumer in the event of a malfunction, error or interruption of the Service as long as it has taken all the necessary measures at its disposal to remedy these malfunctions.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Consumers acknowledge that their access to the Service may be occasionally restricted to allow the correction of errors, maintenance or the introduction of new features or new services.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Consumers must ensure that their equipment is compatible with the Lydia Application and that they have installed the updates necessary for the proper functioning of the Service.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Lydia cannot be held responsible for malfunctions in networks over which it has no control.</span></p>
