              We may change any part of the Terms of Service without telling you beforehand in the following
              circumstances:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
              <li>to reflect changes in laws and regulatory requirements which apply to OnlyFans and the services,
                features and programs of OnlyFans where such changes require OnlyFans to change its terms and
                conditions in a manner which does not allow us to give reasonable notice to you; and</li>
              <li>to address an unforeseen and imminent danger related to defending OnlyFans, Fans or Creators
                from fraud, malware, spam, data breaches or other cybersecurity risks.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We may also make other changes to any part of the Terms of Service, and we will give you
              reasonable notice of such changes by email or through OnlyFans, and you may contact us to end
              your agreement with us before the changes take effect. Once any updated Terms of Service are in
              effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use OnlyFans.

            <strong>We may make changes to or suspend or withdraw OnlyFans:</strong>

            address security issues. We will try to give you reasonable notice of any major changes. We do not
            guarantee that OnlyFans, or any Content on it, will always be available or accessible without
            interruption. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict the availability of all or any part of OnlyFans
            for business or operational reasons. We will try to give you reasonable notice of any suspension or

                <p>If we suspend access to your User account or terminate your agreement with us and your access

            </p>
            <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
              <li>We do not authorize or approve Content on OnlyFans, and views expressed by Creators or Fans
                on OnlyFans do not necessarily represent our views.</li>
              <li>We do not grant you any rights in relation to Content. Any such rights may only be granted
                to you by Creators.</li>
              <li>Your Content may be viewed by individuals that recognise your identity. We will not in any way
                be responsible to you if you are identified from your Content. While we may, from time to time
                and in our sole discretion, offer certain geofencing or geolocation technology on OnlyFans, you

                and you will have no claim against us arising from your use of or reliance upon any geofencing or
                geolocation technology on OnlyFans.</li>
              <li>All Content is created, selected, and provided by Users and not by us. We are not responsible for
                reviewing or moderating Content, and we do not select or modify the Content that is stored or

                own risk.</li>
              <li>We make no promises or guarantees of any kind that Creators or Referring Users will make a
                particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of OnlyFans (including the OnlyFans Referral
                Program).</li>
              <li>The materials which we make accessible on OnlyFans for Users are for general information only.
                We make no promises or guarantees about the accuracy or otherwise of such materials, or that Users
                will achieve any particular result or outcome from using such materials.</li>
              <li>We do not promise that OnlyFans is compatible with all devices and operating systems. You are
                responsible for configuring your information technology, device, and computer programs to access
                OnlyFans. You should use your own virus protection software.</li>
              <li>We are not responsible for the availability of the internet, or any errors in your connections,
                device or other equipment, or software that may occur in relation to your use of OnlyFans.</li>
              <li>While we try to make sure that OnlyFans is secure and free from bugs and viruses, we cannot
                promise that it will be and have no control over the Content that is supplied by Creators.</li>

                You can delete your account at any time, but you acknowledge that deleting your account will
                not of itself prevent the circulation of any of your Content which may have been recorded by

            </p>
            <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
              <li>You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights (examples of which are copyright and
                trademarks) in your Content or that you have obtained all necessary rights to your Content which
                are required to grant licenses in respect of your Content to us and to other Users. This includes
                any rights required to engage in the acts covered by sub-section <strong>10(b)</strong> below in any territory in
                which OnlyFans is accessible and, in particular, in the United States of America, the United Kingdom
                and the European Union.</li>
              <li>You agree to grant us a license under all your Content to perform any act restricted by any
                intellectual property right (including copyright) in such Content, for any purpose reasonably
                related to the provision and operation of OnlyFans. Such acts include to reproduce, make available
                and communicate to the public, display, perform, distribute, translate, and create adaptations or
                derivative works of your Content, and otherwise deal in your Content.</li>
              <li>The license which you grant to us under sub-section <strong>10(b)</strong> above is perpetual, non-exclusive,
                worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, assignable and transferable by us. This means that the
                license will continue even after your agreement with us ends and you stop using OnlyFans, that we
                do not have to pay you for the license, and that we can grant a sub-license of your Content to
                someone else or assign or transfer the license to someone else. This license will allow us, for
                example, to add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content, to make your Content available
                to other Users of OnlyFans, as well as to use your Content for other normal operations of OnlyFans.
                We will never sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell or transfer any license you
                grant to us in the Terms of Service in the event of a sale of our company or its assets to a
                third party.</li>
              <li>Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right to submit notifications of
                infringement (including of copyright or trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or
                service that hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content without your
                permission. Although we are not under any obligation to do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw
                any such notification to any third-party website or service where we consider it appropriate to do so.
                However, we do not and are under no obligation to police infringements of your Content. You agree
                that if we request, you will provide us with all consents and other information which we reasonably
                need to submit notifications of infringement on your behalf. Please see our
                <a href="#complaints-policy">Complaints Policy</a> for how to make a complaint about infringement
                of intellectual property rights.
              </li>
              <li>You waive any moral rights which you may have under any applicable law to object to derogatory
                treatment of any Content posted by you on OnlyFans. This waiver does not affect in any way your
                ownership of any intellectual property rights in your Content or the rights which you have to
                prevent your Content from being copied without your permission. The waiver is intended to allow
                us when dealing with your Content (as permitted by the license which you give us in section <strong>10(b)</strong>
                above) to add watermarks, stickers or text to your Content.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Twitter:</strong> Users have the facility to connect an active Twitter account to their OnlyFans
            account and to share certain Content in the form of OnlyFans posts to Twitter using the share feature.
            If you use this feature, you must fully comply with Twitter's terms of service from time to time in
            respect of any Content shared in this way.

                  <li>You may link to the OnlyFans homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal
                    and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link
                    in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part.</li>
                  <li>If you are a Creator, when promoting your Creator account you must comply with our Terms
                    of Service and the terms of service of any other website where you place a link to or otherwise
                    promote your Creator account. When promoting your Creator account, you must not impersonate
                    OnlyFans or give the impression that your Creator account is being promoted by us if this is
                    not the case. You must not promote your OnlyFans account by using Google Ads or any similar
                    advertising platform or search engine advertising service.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Links from OnlyFans: If OnlyFans contains links to other sites and resources provided by third
                parties, these links are provided for your convenience only. Such links should not be interpreted
                as approval by us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. We have no
                control over the contents of those sites or resources and accept no responsibility for them or for
                any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the
                third-party websites linked to OnlyFans, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the
                terms and conditions of use for such websites.</li>
              <li>
                <p>Domain Names: In some instances, OnlyFans may allow Creators to register or use domain names
                  that contain the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term. However, you will not register
                  such a domain name, unless:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The domain name is registered by the Creator.</li>
                  <li>The domain name redirects to the Creator’s OnlyFans profile. Domain names containing the
                    OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly similar term must not direct to any other website,
                    including link aggregators.</li>
                  <li>The Creator obtains prior written permission from OnlyFans and signs a licensing agreement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If you would like to register a domain name containing the OnlyFans trademark or a confusingly
                  similar term, please contact <a href="mailto:support@onlyfans.com">support@onlyfans.com</a>.
                  Failing to comply with these provisions or the licensing agreement will be considered a violation
                  of the licensing agreement and may result in OnlyFans filing a domain dispute against the registrant.

              <strong>Subscriptions and purchases by Fans:</strong> This section describes the terms which
              apply to Fan/Creator Transactions:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
              <li>
                All Fan/Creator Transactions are contracts between Fans and Creators on the terms of the
                <a href="/contract">Standard Contract between Fan and Creator</a>.
                Although we facilitate Fan/Creator Transactions by providing the OnlyFans platform and storing
                Content we are not a party to the <a href="/contract">Standard Contract between Fan and Creator</a>
                or any other contract which may exist between a Fan and Creator, and are not responsible for
                any Fan/Creator Transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creators are solely responsible for determining (within the parameters for pricing on OnlyFans)
                the pricing applicable to Fan/Creator Transactions and the Content to which you may be given access.
                All prices appear in USD only.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fan Payments are exclusive of VAT, which shall be added at the current rate as applicable to
                Fan Payments.
              </li>
              <li>
                To be able to enter into a Fan/Creator Transaction with a particular Creator, you must first
                add a payment card to your account and then click the 'Subscribe' button on the relevant Creator's
                profile.
              </li>
              <li>
                You authorize us and our subsidiary companies to supply your payment card details to a third-party
                payment provider for the purpose of processing your Fan Payment. All Fan Payments will be charged
                in USD. Your payment card provider may charge you currency conversion fees. We do not have control
                over currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your payment card provider or bank and we and
                our subsidiary companies will not be responsible for paying any charges or fees imposed by your
                payment card provider or bank.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you choose to provide details of two or more payment cards, then if you try to make a Fan Payment
                from the first card and the card is rejected for any reason, then the other payment card will be
                used to collect the full Fan Payment.
              </li>
              <li>
                The payment provider will take (i) periodic payments from your payment card for Fan Payments which
                are Subscriptions; and (ii) immediate payments from your payment card for Fan Payments other than
                Subscriptions (including any tips paid by you to a Creator). You authorize and consent to each of
                these payments being debited using your supplied payment card details.
              </li>
              <li>
                Apart from free-trial Subscriptions, all Subscriptions to a Creator's profile will automatically
                renew at the end of the relevant subscription period, except if your payment card is declined,
                the subscription price for the Subscription has increased, or you have turned off the "Auto-Renew"
                switch located on the relevant Creator's profile. This means that if you want to stop subscribing to
                a Creator's profile and paying continuing monthly subscription charges, you will need to turn off
                the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you cancel a Subscription you will continue to be permitted to view the relevant Creator's Content
                until the end of the subscription period in which you cancelled, after which no further payments will
                be taken from your payment card in respect of subscriptions to that Creator's profile (unless you
                choose to pay for a new Subscription to that Creator’s profile), and you will no longer be able to
                view the relevant Creator's Content.

                You agree that you will not make unjustified requests for a refund in respect of any Fan/Creator
                Transaction or tip to a Creator, or unjustified chargeback requests of your payment card provider
                in relation to any Fan/Creator Transaction or tip to a Creator. If we consider that any request for
                a refund or chargeback request was made by you in bad faith, we have the right to suspend or delete
                your User account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wallet credits: You can prepay an amount on OnlyFans (known as "Wallet Credits") which you can later
                use to make Fan Payments. Purchases on OnlyFans cannot be divided - if you attempt a purchase that
                costs more than the total amount of your remaining Wallet Credits, your payment card will be charged
                the full amount for that purchase. Wallet Credits are subject to a maximum amount as determined by
                us from time to time. Interest will not accrue on Wallet Credits. Wallet Credits are non-refundable,
                which means that you are not entitled to a refund of any unused Wallet Credits.

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Suspension of your User account:</strong> If we suspend your User account in accordance with our
            rights under the Terms of Service, then any Fan Payments which would otherwise have fallen due during
            the period of suspension of your User account will be suspended during the period of the suspension of
            your User account.<br>

              <li>
                If you have chosen the Stripe Payout Option, Stripe will collect the Fan Payment and pay the
                Creator Earnings to your bank account.
              </li>
              <li>Where Stripe is not the Payout Option chosen by you, Our Fee will be deducted from the Fan Payment
                received and your Creator Earnings will be held by us or one of our subsidiary companies on your
                behalf.
              </li>
              <li>Your OnlyFans account will be updated within a reasonable time with your Creator Earnings.
                Your Creator Earnings will become available for withdrawal by you from your OnlyFans account
                once such Creator Earnings appear in your OnlyFans account.</li>
              <li>To make a withdrawal of Creator Earnings from your OnlyFans account, you must have at least
                the minimum payout amount in your OnlyFans account. Please click on the Banking page on your
                account to see what the minimum payout amount is for your country of residence and Payout Option.</li>
              <li>The amount that you see in your ‘current balance’ in your OnlyFans account is your Creator Earnings
                at the relevant time. All Fan Payments and Creator Earnings are transacted in USD only. If you have
                chosen the "Stripe" Payout Option then the Fan Payments and Creator Earnings figures will be reflected
                in your local currency, at an exchange rate controlled by Stripe. Your bank may charge you currency
                conversion or transfer fees to receive the money. Additionally, your e-wallet company may charge
                you a fee for accessing the money. We do not have control over currency exchange rates or charges
                imposed by your bank or your e-wallet company, and we and our subsidiary companies will not be
                responsible for paying any charges imposed by your bank or your e-wallet company.</li>
              <li>If a Fan successfully seeks a refund or chargeback from their credit card provider in respect of
                a Fan Payment made to you, we may investigate and may decide to deduct from your account an amount
                equal to the Creator Earnings earned by you on the charged-back or refunded amount.</li>
              <li>Except for Payout Options involving payment by direct bank transfer, we do not store any data
                disclosed by you when you register your Payout Options with a third-party payment provider.</li>

                Creator Earnings which we determine to be unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or

                due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.

                    to ensure you have not exceeded the VAT registration threshold in the UK. It is your
                    obligation, as a taxable person, to monitor whether you have exceeded the VAT registration
                    threshold.</li>
                  <li>	We do not monitor earnings that Creators receive from other income sources. However, we
                    will monitor the annual earnings of UK Creators on our platform, and if you are not already
                    VAT registered and your earnings exceed the VAT registration threshold, you will receive a
                    notification from us asking you to register for VAT. If you receive such a VAT registration
                    notification, you agree to register for VAT as soon as possible and to send your VAT
                    registration number to us at <a href="mailto:vat@onlyfans.com">vat@onlyfans.com</a>,
                    within 6 weeks of such notification. Failure to do so may result in your OnlyFans account

              <strong>What is the OnlyFans Referral Program?</strong>
              OnlyFans offers a referral program by which existing Users can introduce people who are interested
              in becoming Creators to OnlyFans and receive referral payments from OnlyFans which are calculated
              and limited as described in these Referral Program Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The OnlyFans Referral Program is operated by Fenix International Limited. We are a limited company
              registered in England and Wales, with company registration number 10354575 and we have our registered
              office address at Fourth Floor, Imperial House, 8 Kean Street, London, WC2B 4AS.

              <strong>The rules of the OnlyFans Referral Program:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
              <li>Only Users of OnlyFans with a current User account can participate in the OnlyFans Referral
                Program. If a User's account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by
                the User, that User will not be eligible to participate in the OnlyFans Referral Program.</li>
              <li>You will need on your User account page to add a bank account or a payment method details of your
                bank account or a payment method in order to receive referral payments under the OnlyFans Referral
                Program.</li>
              <li>Each User has a unique referral link (which can be accessed via the User's User account) which the
                User may share with others. When sharing your unique referral link you must not impersonate OnlyFans
                or give the impression that your referral link is being shared or promoted by us. You must not use
                Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service to share or
                promote your unique referral link. Upon our request, you must disclose the methods by which you share
                your unique referral link in the Bio/Website field of your OnlyFans account.</li>
              <li>The Referred Creator must click on your unique referral link and then register with OnlyFans
                using the same browser that they used to click on your unique referral link. If someone registers
                with OnlyFans other than by using your unique referral link, we will not link that account to your
                referral and no referral payments will be made to you.</li>
              <li>The Referred Creator must not have opened a User account with OnlyFans (whether under the same
                name or another name) before clicking on your unique referral link. If the Referred Creator is
                currently or has previously been a User of OnlyFans no referral payments will be made to you for
                the referral.</li>
              <li>If the Referred Creator sets up more than one User account referral payments will be made
                to you on the earnings made by the Referred Creator from their first User account only. No referral
                payments will be made to you on any further User accounts set up by the Referred Creator.</li>
              <li>No referral payments will be made to you on any referral of a Referred Creator which we determine
                is owned or operated by you, or is in a commercial relationship with you. You will provide any
                information which we request to enable us to determine whether the Referred Creator is owned or
                operated by you or if there is a commercial relationship between you and the Referred Creator.</li>
              <li>
                <p>You agree that when promoting OnlyFans in any way as a Referring User:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>you will not give a false impression of OnlyFans, the services, programs, and content
                    (including Content) made available through OnlyFans, its Users or the Terms of Service; and</li>
                  <li>you will not make any statements which suggest to a potential Creator that the potential
                    Creator will make a particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of OnlyFans, or any
                    statements regarding the likely number of Fans.</li>
                </ul>

              <strong>Referral payments:</strong>

            <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>How are referral payments calculated?</strong> Once a Referred Creator has become a
                  registered User of OnlyFans in accordance with the rules of the OnlyFans Referral Program
                  described above, the Referring User will be paid a referral payment equal to five per cent
                  (5%) of Fan Payments generated by the Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on
                  which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, up to a maximum referral
                  payment by OnlyFans to the Referring User of US$50,000 per Referred Creator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This means that if a Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of US$1 million or
                  more in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User
                  of OnlyFans, then the Referring User's referral payments in relation to that Referred Creator
                  will be capped at US$50,000 in total. However, if the Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with
                  a total value of less than US$1 million in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred
                  Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, then the Referring User will be paid five per cent
                  (5%) of the Fan Payments generated by that Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date
                  on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, following which no further
                  referral payments will be made to the Referring User in respect of that Referred Creator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For all referrals made prior to 1 May 2020, referral payments will be made to the relevant
                  Referring Users until 1 May 2021 or until US$50,000 has been paid out to the Referring User on
                  the referral, whichever occurs first.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>VAT:</strong> If you are a Referring User you should know that all referral payments
                payable to you by us will be inclusive of any VAT (as defined in the
                <a href="#terms-use-creators">Terms of Use for Creators</a>) which is or becomes chargeable on any
                supplies made by you, except as provided for in the "
                <a href="#promoting-tax-compliance-vat">Promoting Tax compliance and VAT</a>"
                section of the <a href="#terms-use-creators">Terms of Use for Creators</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> In compliance with regulation 3 of the Trading Scheme Regulations 1997 (as amended) and section 120(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, please read the warning below in respect of the OnlyFans Referral Program:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is illegal for us or for a participant in the OnlyFans Referral Program
                    (including Referring Users and Referred Creators) to persuade anyone to make a payment by
                    promising benefits from getting others to join the OnlyFans Referral Program.</li>
                  <li>Do not be misled by claims that high earnings are easily achieved from participation in the
                    OnlyFans Referral Program.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Choosing a payout method to receive referral payments:</strong> In order to be able to
                receive referral payments you must first choose one of the payout methods provided by OnlyFans in
                your country of residence. These methods are called "Payout Options".</li>
              <li><strong>How frequently are referral payments made?</strong> The referral payment due to you on Fan
                Payments made to the Referred Creator in a calendar month will be transferred to you on or around
                the first day of the next calendar month (which means, for example, that referral payments due to
                you in respect of Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in February shall be paid to you on or
                around 1 March).</li>
              <li><strong>Who bears the cost of the referral payment?</strong> The cost of the referral payment is
                borne by us, not the Referred Creator.</li>

              <li>If referral payments have been made incorrectly then we have the right to recover the wrongly
                paid sums from the User to whom the wrongly paid sums have been paid.</li>
              <li>We may request you or Referred Creators (or both) to provide us with ID and other information
                reasonably required by us to verify any referral payment to be made and the person to whom any
                referral payment should be made. Failure to provide any information requested by us may lead to you
                losing your entitlement to referral payments in respect of the relevant Referred Creator.</li>
              <li>We may change any aspect of the OnlyFans Referral Program (including how referral payments are
                calculated) or discontinue the OnlyFans Referral Program at any time, but no change will deprive any
                Referring User of referral payments already earned based on Fan Payments made to Referred Creators
                before the changes came into effect.</li>

              <strong>Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:</strong>

            <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
              <li>
                <p>We may withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the
                    Terms of Service;</li>
                  <li>if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or
                    could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused
                    to us or another User); or</li>
                  <li>if we suspect that all or any part of the referral payments due to you result from unlawful or
                    fraudulent activity, either by you, by the Fan who made the Fan Payment to the Referred Creator
                    which resulted in the referral payment, or by the Referred Creator to whom the Fan Payment was
                    made which resulted in the referral payment,</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach(es) by you or
                  the suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity (as applicable). If following our investigation,
                  we conclude that
                  (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;
                  (ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has
                  or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused
                  to us or another User), and/or
                  (iii) all or any part of referral payments due to you result from unlawful or fraudulent activity,
                  we may notify you that you have forfeited all or any part of your referral payments.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>We may also withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out if we
                receive notice that you have secured, encumbered, pledged, assigned, or otherwise allowed a lien to
                be placed on, referral payments. We undertake no duty to pay referral payments to third-party
                lienholders and may withhold payment of Creator Earnings until the lien has been removed.</li>
              <li>We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment due to you under
                the OnlyFans Referral Program where we have a right to do so under these Referral Program Terms.</li>
              <li>
                If we are withholding all or any part of the referral payments due to you and we determine that part
                of the referral payments withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or
                suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity, then we may arrange for you to be paid the part of the referral
                payments which is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful
                or fraudulent activity. However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of
                Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid
                and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.
