<h3>Privacy Policy.</h3>

Proctorio encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes and to subscribe to receive update notifications from us on <a href="https://github.com/proctorio/policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.

</article>
<article>
<h3>Privacy.</h3>
<p>Any content you provide to Proctorio is subject to this Privacy Policy, which governs our collection of your information and content, and the forwarding of such information to your institution, university, college, school, or organization (collectively, "<b>Institution</b>"). You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and forwarding (as set forth in this Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to your college, university, instructor, school or organization. In providing the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as technical support messages. These communications are considered part of the Services, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.</p>
<p>You agree to have your identity verified by Proctorio using the methodology that is most currently employed by Proctorio.</p>
<p>You agree to allow Proctorio to monitor you by webcam, microphone, browser, desktop, or any other means necessary to uphold integrity. At the discretion of the exam administrator, this may include a scan of your surroundings and computer display. This monitoring will be conducted by machine or by a live person. The information from the session may be recorded and provided to the institution, university, college, school, or organization and can be viewed by authorized personnel thereof. It is important to note that this information is not sold, or given to any third parties.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Proctorio is committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of your information. Towards this end, we take the following actions: (a) we limit employee access to your information to only those employees who need the information to fulfill their job responsibilities; (b) we conduct regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and (c) we protect your information with technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards in order to protect against unauthorized access, release or use.</p>

<h3>De-Identified Data and Aggregate Information.</h3>
<p>Proctorio may use certain De-Identified Data collected from the use of our Site or the Services, such as from an Institution's Student Users who use the Application Service under Institution's rights, and through an agreement with Institution, for identifying trends, statistics, security, research, or other purposes. "De-Identified Data" is data we create from collected data by removing all direct and indirect personal identifiers including, but not limited to, name and location information. Proctorio agrees not to attempt to re-identify De-Identified Data and not to transfer De-Identified Data unless that party agrees not to attempt re-identification.</p>
<p>We may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, and IP addresses. However, we use certain methods to anonymize your IP address at the earliest possible stage of the collection network. Specifically, we anonymize the IP address by removing the last octet of the address. We may also analyze tracked data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and will not contain Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>Proctorio does not directly collect payment information and is not a money-services business. To the extent such functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other third-party service, subject to their terms of use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Proctorio may invoice Customers according to an applicable SaaS Agreement.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Proctorio takes privacy extremely seriously, and strictly adheres to the Family Education Rights Protection Act of 1974 (FERPA). Proctorio works with Institution(s) to ensure compliance with FERPA and applicable privacy laws, and one of the most important ways in which it ensures compliance with FERPA is by never storing any student personally identifiable information or education records in unencrypted form. Refer to the <a href="/ferpa">FERPA Policy</a> for more information.</p>

<article>
<h3>Information Collection and Use.</h3>
<p>You can generally visit our Site without revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. To use the Services, however, we may be required to collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, phone number, and institution ("<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>"). Additionally, we may invite you to participate in surveys, questionnaires, contests, or to contact us with questions, comments, or to provide us with feedback, which due to the nature of some of these activities, may include the collection of Personally Identifiable Information. By accessing or using the Services, we might collect additional data as set forth below in the "Aggregate Information" paragraph. All student records obtained by Proctorio from an Institution are the property of and are under the control of that Institution.</p>
<p>We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you to deliver certain services, news, or information related to the Services, verify your authority to use our Services, and improve the content and general administration of the Services. If you do not wish for your Personally Identifiable Information to be used as described in this Section, you should not use the Services. You may also opt out of receiving promotional notifications by following the opt-out instructions in the emails that are sent to you.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Under no circumstances will this information be disseminated to third parties for any use, and Proctorio will never use this information for targeted advertising.</p>
<p><b>Secure Exam Proctor Administration:</b> To register an Institution to use the Proctorio Secure Exam Proctor solution, an administrator account must be created. To register this account, Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, phone number, Institution name, and campus email address), must be provided along with information regarding the learning management system ("<b>LMS</b>") used by the Institution.</p>
<p><b>Secure Exam Proctor Request for Demo:</b> To request a demonstration of the Proctorio Secure Exam Proctor solution, Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, phone number, Institution name, and campus email address), must be provided along with information regarding the LMS used by the Institution.</p>
<p><b>Secure Exam Proctor Exam Environment:</b> You can generally utilize the Secure Exam Proctor for taking a proctored examination without revealing any Personally Identifiable Information about yourself. The information collected during the examination process will only be used in an anonymized form for product development. The types of information collected depend on the exam settings and can include video, audio, and websites visited.</p>
<p><b>Secure Exam Proctor Technical Support:</b> To contact technical support Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, phone number, Institution name, and campus email address), may be collected to facilitate the troubleshooting process. Disclosure of such information is considered voluntary and will not be used to create an academic record nor given or sold to third parties.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Proctorio's technical support complies with FERPA and all employees are required to complete FERPA training.</p>
<p>Legal Basis for processing your information. If you are a user or located in the European Economic Area ("<b>EEA</b>"), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate business interests. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you. If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided below.</p>

<h3>Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).</h3>
<p>Except for our specific services offered to K-12 Institutions, our Services are directed towards adults who are of the legal age to access them in their respective jurisdictions and who reside in the United States. By accessing and using our Services, you represent and warrant that you are of the legal age to form a binding contract with us in your respective jurisdiction and that you meet the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet these requirements, you must not access or use the Services. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from an individual who was ineligible to access or use the Services, we will take steps to remove such information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a user who is ineligible to use the Services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@proctorio.com" style="color:#191919">privacy@proctorio.com</a>.</p>
<p>We are COPPA certified by the Internet Keep Safe Coalition which signifies our compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Please see our COPPA policy page and Personal Data Protections page for more information.</p>
<p>Proctorio does not disseminate personal information to third parties for any use. All data that enters our system has been encrypted using an unshared key stored in the learning management system (LMS) and can only be unlocked by authorized users within the LMS. Proctorio utilizes the LMS to gain information about the user's role. This restricts information from being shared with users who do not fall under the Institution's "School Official" role. The entire process is transparent to the end-user, but prevents Proctorio and unauthorized individuals from accessing student data. In compliance with section 16 C.F.R. § 312.4(c)(2) of COPPA, Proctorio will notify parents when it learns that it has collected any personal information of a child under 13 years of age.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>K-12 Institutions and Children's Privacy.</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we are COPPA compliant. We collect limited Personal Information from administrative personnel at the K-12 Institution only as needed for the operation and management of the Services as contracted by the K-12 Institution.</p>
<p>Minor Users can access many parts of the Services and its content and use many of its features without providing us with Personal Information.</p>
<p>We only collect as much information about a Minor User as is reasonably necessary for the minor to receive the Services provided to the minor through an agreement between us and the K-12 Institution. We do not condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>Notice to Parents - Consent.</h3>
<p>By inputting any Personal Information (whether your Personal Information, or Personal Information of your child), you consent to the use of that Personal Information within the Services, and you represent and warrant that you have obtained any permissions or authorizations for any Personal Information of others that you input or send through the Services.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>Notice to Minors.</h3>
<p>If you are a Minor User, do not send any personal information about yourself or other students to us, other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services. Students who have signed up with an access code provided by a school or teacher should be aware that their parent/legal guardian has access to all information within or associated with their account.</p>

<h3>Do Not Track Settings.</h3>
<p>Some internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. We respond to Do Not Track signals by not tracking browser and URL information collected through a tracking pixel.

<h3>Aggregate Information</h3>
<p>We may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, and IP addresses. We may also analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and will not contain Personally Identifiable Information.

<h3>Third Party Services.</h3>
<p>Proctorio uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs, help center, and knowledge bases, and to help us understand the use of our Services. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>

<p>Proctorio will store and maintain institutional data for up to 30 days after the termination of an applicable agreement, unless otherwise specified. If, however, you have entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio then we will retain your data for six months by active data retention and for one year by cold storage. We may be able to retain your data for longer periods of time subject to an additional fee and agreement by you and Proctorio.</p>
<p>According to the Institution's preference regarding data destruction, Proctorio will either: 1) destroy the data, or 2) deliver it to the Institution.</p>
<p>Questions regarding data storage, recovery, and deletion should be directed to:</p>
