<h3>12. Indemnification.</h3>
<p>If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, Proctorio agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold You harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or damages resulting from any third party claim that the Application Service and/or the Application Documentation infringes such third party’s U.S. patents issued as of the Effective Date or infringes or misappropriates, as applicable, such third party’s copyrights or trade secret rights under applicable laws of any jurisdiction, provided You promptly notify Proctorio in writing of the claim, cooperate with Proctorio, and allow Proctorio sole authority to control the defense and settlement of such claim. You agree to permit Proctorio, at Proctorio’s sole discretion, to enable You to continue to use the Application Service or the Application Documentation, or to modify or replace any such infringing material to make it non-infringing. If none of these alternatives is available, You shall, upon Proctorio’s written request, cease use of, and, if applicable, return, materials subject to the infringement claim. This provision shall not apply if the alleged infringement arises from any: (i) modification of the Application IP; (ii) combination, operation, or use of the Application IP with other non-Proctorio provided software, hardware or technology; (iii) use of a superseded or altered release of any of the Application IP, if You failed to use a then-current release of the Application IP we provided to you; (iv) Customer Content; or (v) Third Party Products (any of the foregoing circumstances under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) a "<b>Customer Indemnity Responsibility</b>"). THIS IS PROCTORIO’S ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION CLAIMS, AND PROCTORIO’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL NOT EXCEED PROCTORIO’S LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>To the extent allowable by law You agree to hold harmless, indemnify, and, at Proctorio’s option, defend Proctorio from and against any losses, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or damages resulting from: (i) Your or any Authorized End User’s negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) Your or any Authorized End User’s unauthorized use of the Application IP; or (iii) a Customer Indemnity Responsibility, provided that You will not settle any third-party claim against Proctorio without Proctorio’s consent.</p>

<h3>13. K-12 Institutions.</h3>
<p>We recognize that certain privacy protections apply specifically to minors, and accordingly have implemented additional privacy and security protections in place for minor users. If you are accessing and using the Services as a representative of a K-12 Institution, as a parent of a child attending a K-12 Institution (collectively, "Minor Representative"), or as the minor child who has been given parental permission by a parent, the following terms will also apply to you.</p>
<p>A. Student Users. Minor students agree that they have obtained consent from a parent/legal guardian for their use of the Site and Services in connection with educational uses. By using the Site and Services, if you are a minor, you represent that you have obtained consent from your parent/legal guardian who has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf. If you do not obtain such consent, then you are not authorized to use the Site or the Services.</p>
<p>B. Parents and Guardians. As a parent or guardian, you represent and warrant that you are over the age of majority; that you are entering into this Agreement on your behalf and on the behalf of your minor student, and that you have authority to bind an you and your minor students to the terms herein. You acknowledge and agree that minor students cannot use the Site and Services without a parent/legal guardian first accepting this Agreement on their behalf. To the extent your minor student needs to set up an account, you, as the parent or guardian are responsible for doing so, and are responsible for both all information provided in setting up that account, and all actions taken by the minor student using that account.</p>
<p>C. Collection of Student Information. We collect only the personal information from students that is needed for the operation and management of the Services, and only where the educational institution has contracted with Proctorio to do so. We first require that the educational institution obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to collecting such information. If you are a minor student, do not send any personal information about yourself other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services. Further information concerning how student information is handled can be found in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>14. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability.</h3>
<p>This section limits the liability of Proctorio and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the "<b>Proctorio Entities</b>"). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to You. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights You may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
<h4>A. The Services are Available "AS-IS"</h4>
<p>You access and use the Services and Content at Your own risk. You understand and agree that Proctorio provides these Services and Content to You on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Proctorio Entities or through the Services or Content, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p>

<h4>C. Limitation of Liability</h4>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROCTORIO ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (i) YOUR ACCESS TO,USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT</p>
<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE PROCTORIO ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR, FOR AN INSTITUTION THE AMOUNT YOU PAID PROCTORIO, IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS.</p>
<p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PROCTORIO ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

<h4>D. Assignment; Delegation.</h4>
<p>If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, You may not assign any of Your rights or duties under the SaaS Agreement, without Proctorio’s prior written consent. Proctorio may assign any SaaS Agreement, without consent, if there is a merger, sale, transfer, or other disposition of all or most of its stock or assets.</p>
<h4>E. Proctorio Testing Center Membership.</h4>
<p>If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, You agree to participate in any testing center program that Proctorio may require. Our current testing center program allows any educational institution’s Authorized End User to travel to any other Proctorio-participating institution and utilize that location’s testing center space (the "<b>Proctorio Testing Center Program</b>"). As a result, You must provide Your testing center facilities to an Authorized End User who received access to Proctorio’s services from another educational institution, without charge. You agree to comply with all policies and procedures: (i) we specify from time to time relating to Authorized End Users who wish to utilize Proctorio’s services from multiple institutions; and (ii) we may specify for the Proctorio Testing Center program.</p>
<h4>F. Payment.</h4>
<p>To the extent the Services or any portion thereof is made available for any fee or through a subscription, your access will be granted following payment of the applicable fees to Company. Your account and access to the Services may be suspended in the event of non-payment of applicable fees.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant to Company that such payment information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. For recurring subscriptions, you will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.</p>
<h4>G. Force Majeure.</h4>
<p>Except for Payment, if You are prevented or delayed in performing Your obligations by circumstances beyond Your reasonable control, including, war, riot, fires, floods, epidemics, or failure of public utilities or public transportation systems, the failure or delay is not a material breach of the applicable SaaS Agreement, but the obligation will remain in full force and effect, and will be performed as soon as reasonably practicable after the termination of the relevant circumstances causing such delay, but if You are prevented from performing for more than ninety (90) days, the other Party may terminate the SaaS Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.</p>
<h4>H. Advertising.</h4>
<p>If You entered into a SaaS Agreement with Proctorio, and gave prior written consent, we may reference and use Your name and trademarks, and disclose Proctorio’s services for business development and marketing efforts, including on our website. Proctorio will not use any Customer Content to advertise or market to students or their parents. Proctorio may use de-identified data for advertising or marketing to schools.</p>
<h4>I. Independent Contractors.</h4>
<p>You and Proctorio will, at all times, act as independent contractors, and nothing contained in these Terms, or any other agreement, will be construed or implied to create an agency, partnership, or employer and employee relationship.</p>
<h4>J. Waiver and Severability.</h4>
<p>The failure of Proctorio to enforce any right or provision of these Terms, or any other applicable agreement, will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms, or any other applicable agreement, is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h4>K. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction.</h4>
<p>These Terms, any action related thereto, and all other agreements between You and Proctorio, unless otherwise stated, will be governed by Delaware State Law without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or Your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings, or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, and You consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>If You are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses, then those clauses do not apply to You. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding choice of law).</p>
<h4>L. Entire Agreement.</h4>
<p>These Terms and our <a href="/privacy" style="color:#191919;">Privacy Policy</a> are the entire and exclusive agreement between Proctorio and You regarding the Services (excluding any services for which You have an additional agreement with Proctorio), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Proctorio and You regarding the Services. Other than members of the group of companies of which Proctorio is the parent, no other person or company will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at proctorio.com/terms. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised Terms. Any amendment to a SaaS Agreement, however, must be in writing made by the Parties, or their authorized representatives.</p>
