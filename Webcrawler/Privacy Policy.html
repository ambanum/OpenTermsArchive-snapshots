<!--ip34--><p  ><strong><u>California Information We Collected and/or Shared</u></strong></p>
<!--ip35--><p  >This section of the Policy provides the information California residents need to exercise their rights over their California Information. Here is information about the California Information we may have collected from and shared about consumers over the twelve months prior to the Effective Date of this Policy.</p>
<!--ip36--><p  >In the year before the date this Policy was updated, on or through some of our Services we may have collected and/or shared (for operational purposes with providers who provide services for or to us in connection with developing, improving, providing and/or offering our Services) the following categories of California Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address and other identifiers &#8212; such as email address, device type, web-browser, operating system or other similar identifiers;</li>
<li>Unique and online identifiers &#8212; such as IP address, device IDs derived from device type, or other similar identifiers;</li>
<li>Characteristics of protected classifications &#8212; such as race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation;</li>

<li>Online viewing activities and habits (e.g., videos viewed, pages viewed); and</li>
<li>Inferences drawn from California Information, such as individual profiles, preferences, characteristics and behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<!--ip37--><p  >We may have collected these categories of California Information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing services on behalf of our various businesses, such as user retention, providing content recommendations and/or processing information;</li>
<li>Fraud and crime prevention;</li>
<li>Debugging errors in systems;</li>
<li>Marketing and advertising;</li>
<li>Internal research, analytics and development &#8212; e.g., user-preference analytics; and</li>

However, a &#8220;sale&#8221; under the CCPA may be considered to include the sharing of California Information in exchange for anything of value. According to this broad definition, in the year before the date this Policy was updated, on or through some of our Services we may be deemed to have sold the following categories of California Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address and other identifiers &#8212; such as email address, device type, web-browser, operating system or other similar identifiers;</li>
