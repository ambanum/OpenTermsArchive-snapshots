We may also collect and analyse any comments, photos, messages or other content or communications you and other users share on the Services or send to each other.</p><p>g. <strong>Third-Party Social Networking Sites.</strong> When you have enabled the use of our Services through a third-party social networking site or mobile or other application such as Facebook, Google+ or Twitter (a &#8220;Social Networking Site&#8221;) or connect or link our Services to a Social Networking Site, you permit Zoosk to access and use certain information about you that is made available to Zoosk through or from that Social Networking Site. The information obtained by Zoosk varies by Social Networking Site and may be affected by the permission and privacy settings you establish at that Social Networking Site, but can include information such as your name, profile picture, public Facebook profile, network, gender, username, user ID, age range or birthday, place of work, relationship interests, language, location, country, interests, photos, photos you are tagged in, videos, contacts list, friends lists or followers and other information such as information about Facebook friends you might share in common with other members of the Services. By using or linking our Services through or with a Social Networking Site, you are authorizing Zoosk to collect, store, retain and use, in accordance with this Policy, any and all of your information that Zoosk has obtained from the Social Networking Site, including to create a Zoosk profile page and account for you. Depending on the Social Networking Site and your privacy settings, Zoosk may also post information to your Social Networking Site. Your agreement to the foregoing takes place when you &#8220;accept&#8221; or &#8220;allow&#8221; or “go to” (or other similar terms, such as tapping “Okay”) our application from a Social Networking Site, go to a Social Networking Site from the Services, when you sign up or login to the Services through a Social Networking Site (such as by tapping “Sign up with Facebook” or “Log in with Facebook” on the Services), when you otherwise connect or link your Social Networking Site to our Services, or the transfer of information to Zoosk from such site. If there is information about your “friends” or people you are associated with in your Social Networking Site account, the information we obtain about those persons may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable Social Networking Site. You acknowledge and agree that Zoosk is not responsible for, and has no control over, any applicable privacy settings on any Social Networking Sites (including any settings related to any messages or advertisements about Zoosk that the Social Networking Site may send to you or your friends). You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on Social Networking Sites before getting or using applications such as ours or linking or connecting your Social Networking Site account to the Services.</p><p>h. <strong>Location Data.</strong> We do not currently collect and store your precise geolocation or precise latitude or longitude coordinates for you. Some of the information we collect, for example an IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a device’s location. In some cases, we assign the latitude and longitude of the centre of a city or state on record for you to your profile as a way to improve our analytics and matches for you.</p><p>i. <strong>Information Provided by Others.</strong> We may be provided with information relating to you or your conduct on the Services by other users of the Services. For example, we will collect your email address if another user tries to refer Zoosk to you.

We will store those contacts for purposes of alerting you when your contacts join the Services or other products or services offered by Zoosk at a later time, so that you may connect with them on Zoosk, and to suggest friends and connections to other members of the Services or other products or services offered by Zoosk.</p><p>We also collect, use and share aggregated and/or anonymous data (“Aggregated Data”) for any purpose. Examples include aggregated statistical or demographic data or data provided in hashed, non-human readable form. For example, we may aggregate your usage data on how you use the Services (“Usage Data”) to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but does not directly or indirectly identify you and therefore does not amount to personal data.</p><h3>CROSS DEVICE TRACKING</h3><p>If you login to your account with Zoosk using multiple devices (for instance, your phone and laptop), we will link your devices to your account. This allows us to provide a seamless user experience to you. We also work with third parties to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modelling tools, which attempt to recognize you across multiple devices so that we understand how you use our Service across various devices, to ensure the safety and security of your data and the Zoosk Services, to show you targeted advertising (with your consent) tailored to your interests and experience, and to measure the performance of advertising campaigns.</p><h3>IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h3><p>Where you do not provide the personal data detailed in this Policy, we may not be able to provide you with the Services.</p><h2><a name="howWeUse"></a>3.

DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2><p>Our Services allow you to share information about yourself with other individuals and other companies, including other users and potential users of the Services or other products or services offered by Zoosk and third-party Social Networking Sites. Consider your own privacy and personal safety when sharing your information with anyone, including information you share through your profile, as profiles include basic information that was provided at registration, information provided through a Social Networking Site, and may include other information added by you or your friends (for example, your religion, ethnicity and physical characteristics), as well as information about your use of the Service (for example, whether you were recently logged in to Zoosk). Please review our <a href="https://www.zoosk.com/safety">Online Dating Safety Tips</a> for tips in using our Services.</p><p>Information on your profile is viewable by other users or visitors to our Services, and may also be viewable through public search or on third-party sites that you use. We do not control who reads the information you share or what others may do with this information, so we encourage you to use discretion and caution with respect to your personal data. Also, when sharing information about others, please consider their safety and privacy and get their consent for that sharing.</p><p>We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes in the table above.</p><p>• With other companies within the Zoosk group of companies (currently Zoosk Ireland Limited and Zoosk UK Limited) in order to provide you with the Services.</p><p>• Technology Services Providers, including infrastructure partners (such as AWS), customer support service providers, analytics service providers, cybersecurity partners, anti-fraud analytics companies, payment providers, chargeback representation services and similar partners.</p><p>• Advertising networks and technology companies, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and companies that measure advertising performance and attribution.</p><p>• Third parties, including consultants, who we engage to provide services on our behalf or to jointly provide services to you, including but not limited to contests and sweepstakes, marketing outreach and analytics, customer support, safety checks, and payment services.</p><p>• Social Networks, such as Facebook and Google+, where you have given permission to do so or where you have used your social network account to log-in to Zoosk. If you have chosen to do this, your data will be governed by the privacy policy of that social network.</p><p>• to, in our discretion, (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena/court order, legal process or other government request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Use Agreement, including the investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Zoosk, its users or the public as required or permitted by law and (v) detect, prevent or otherwise address criminal (including fraud or stalking), security or technical issues.</p><p>• In connection with any company transaction, such as a merger, sale of assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company or third party or in the event of bankruptcy, dissolution, divestiture or any related or similar proceedings.</p><p>We require third parties to respect the security and privacy of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. The majority of the third parties we share your personal data with are service providers that are permitted to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions only. Some third parties will process your personal data for their own purposes as data controllers; please refer to their privacy policy which applies to their processing of your personal data. We are not responsible for those third parties.</p><h2><a name="intlTransfers"></a>5. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2><p>The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored in the United States of America and other countries. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from E.U. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal data, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the U.S. or any other country in which Zoosk or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities, and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. Zoosk will take reasonable measures to help protect your personal data in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction and to treat it in accordance with this Policy.</p><p>Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p><p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA to a country that is not considered by the European Commission to offer an adequate level of protection for personal data, we do so using the following mechanisms:</p><p>• Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</p><p>• Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</p><h2><a name="dataSecurity"></a>6. DATA SECURITY</h2><p>At Zoosk, we strongly believe in protecting your privacy. As a result, we have put in place reasonable security measures to help prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. We work hard to ensure that the third parties we do provide access to your personal data to, such as our technology service providers like Amazon Web Services, also have reasonable security measures in place.</p><p>No platform, service, or method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. We work hard to keep evolving our security measures to keep up with the bad actors and other threats of the world to help protect your personal data.</p><p>We may also share your personal data, including your payment transactions and activities on the Zoosk Services, with third party partners for security and fraud prevention purposes. These partners collect, process and analyse such data for the purpose of helping their customers to identify and prevent fraud.<br /> We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p><h2><a name="dataRetention"></a>7. DATA RETENTION</h2><h3>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</h3><p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected and/or processed it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p><p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p><p>We also retain backups of the Zoosk Services, including your personal data, on a rolling basis according to our internal data retention, disaster recovery, and business continuity policies. Our backups are stored off-site in the United States and in secure facilities in order to help ensure the protection of your personal data and the Services.</p><h3>EXCEPTIONS</h3><p>We retain blacklists of fraudulent activity or security threats indefinitely in order to protect the security of the Zoosk Services and your personal data. We share these blacklists with third party service providers in order to continue to improve the security of our Services and your personal data.</p><p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research, statistical or other purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p><h2><a name="yourLegalRights"></a>8. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2><p>You may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws in relation to your personal data. As examples, you have the right to:</p><p>➢ Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p><p>➢ Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p><p>➢ Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p><p>➢ Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have overriding legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p>➢ Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the accuracy of the personal data; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need the personal data for the purposes set out above, but we are required by you for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p><p>➢ Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p>➢ Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide the Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.<br /> For more information on what we provide and how to access it, please see the Privacy FAQs <a href="https://docviewer.zoosk.com/legal-faq-en.html">here</a>. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us at Customer Support.</p><h3>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</h3><p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><h3>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h3><p>We will need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who does not have a right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request. For more information, please go <a href="https://docviewer.zoosk.com/legal-faq-en.html">here</a>.</p><h3>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</h3><p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty (30) days. Occasionally it may take us longer if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p><h2><a name="contactUs"></a>9.
